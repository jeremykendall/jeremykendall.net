I'm proud to announce the launch of [400mToGo](http://www.400mtogo.com), a blog about all things Nike+, including tips, news, tutorials, reviews, and the personal experiences of three "very amateur but passionate runners."

The brainchild of [Scott Wills](http://www.scottwills.co.uk), the 400mToGo team includes Scott, [Cory Wiles](http://www.corywiles.com), and myself.  We love to run, we're passionate about the [Nike+ sport kit](http://astore.amazon.com/400mtogo-20/detail/B000JVFKH8/002-4713628-0781646), and we decided that we wanted to give back to and participate in the growing Nike+ community in a more meaningful way.

From the 400mToGo [About](http://www.400mtogo.com/about/) page:

400mToGo is a Web site for Nike+® runners of all abilities. If, like us, you are obsessed with running data and refuse to go running unless you have your Apple® iPod® Nano and your Nike+ chip securely attached, then this is the Web site for you.

Current stories include a [review of the Couch to 5k running plan](http://www.400mtogo.com/2008/02/03/my-experience-with-the-couch-to-5k-plan/), a piece about Scott's [excellent experiences with Nike's customer support](http://www.400mtogo.com/2008/02/06/first-class-support/), and a bit of [good advice](http://www.400mtogo.com/2008/02/05/and-im-feelin-good/) for every runner by Cory.

Are you ready to get running?  Visit [400mToGo](http://www.400mtogo.com) today.
