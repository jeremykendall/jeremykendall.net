It's my pleasure to announce the formation of [Memphis PHP](http://memphisPHP.org), a PHP user group serving Memphis, TN and the mid-south.  The goal of Memphis PHP is to grow and nurture an active PHP community in the local area.  It's going to take a lot of work to get Memphis PHP off the ground, but having an active community of PHP developers in Memphis is long overdue.  The hard work will be more than worth it, and I'm going to need your help to accomplish that goal.

My first exposure to the PHP community at large came when I attended [ZendCon](http://zendcon.com/) in 2008.  After getting a taste of what the PHP community had to offer, I was pretty bummed out that we didn't have anything going in Memphis.  Attending ZendCon in '08 led to attending ZendCon in '09, Nashville's excellent [Big LAMP Camp](http://enterpriselamp.org/) event last November, and I just returned from the [tek-X](http://tek.phparch.com/) conference in Chicago.

One of my favorite sessions at this year's tek-X was the [Community Roundtable](http://joind.in/talk/view/1698), "an all-star lineup of community members" discussing user groups: what they are, how to start them, and how to keep them going.  It was the Community Roundtable that finally convinced me enough was enough, that it was time to start a user group right here in Memphis, TN.
