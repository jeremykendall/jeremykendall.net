Thanks for visiting the personal site of [Jeremy Kendall](http://www.jeremykendall.net), web developer and entrepreneur.  I hate sites that are "Under Construction" and have always felt that you should build content and flesh out your project in a development environment before going live.  Yeah, well, I guess this makes me both the cobbler and the cobbler's shoeless kid.

I'm a [PHP](http://php.net) / [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com) developer primarily.  I'm working on my [Java](http://java.sun.com/) chops as we speak.  My day job is a junior development position, I'm working on building a freelance development business into a second, viable stream of income, and I'm an [Original Limu](http://memphis.originallimu.com) distributor as well.  Find out more about Original Limu [here](http://jeremykendall.net/limu).

2008 got here well before I was ready for it, and the new year finds me as busy as I've ever been with multiple new projects.  What you're seeing is a new [CMS](http://drupal.org) running on the home page, and me with no time to dig in and learn it.  This is going to be a fun project, but as it's a personal project, it will be catch as catch can until I get a few hours to spend reading some Drupal for n00bs stuff.

In the meantime I have some exciting [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com) projects in the works with a couple more on the way.  I'm working on my first Java project at the day job, which is exciting but leaves my brain a pile of mush by the end of the work day.  As soon as I deliver those projects there will be more time for my personal projects.  I think this is what they call "job security."
