Thanks to yesterday's link love from [PHPDeveloper](http://phpdeveloper.org/news/19985),
I've made both the [Trending PHP Developer](https://github.com/trending/developers?l=php)
list and the [Trending PHP Repo](https://github.com/trending?l=php) list on GitHub.

With internet fame being so fleeting, I took some screenshots for posterity.  Now please
excuse me while I get some ice for my arm. I seem to have injured myself while patting
myself on the back.
