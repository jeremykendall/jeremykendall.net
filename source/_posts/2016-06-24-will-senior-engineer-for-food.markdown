**UPDATE:** Sorry companies that didn't snatch me up while I was available, but
I'm no longer on the market! As of August 2016 I'm working as a Senior Software
Engineer at [Alegion](https://alegion.com/). I'm stoked to be a part of an
amazing company and a member of one of the best teams I've ever had the
pleasure to work with.

After two amazing, challenging, crazy, exhausting years with [Graph Story](http://graphstory.com/),
I've decided that it's time to find a new challenge and a new workplace to call home.

I've grown more as a developer in the past two years than I have in my entire
career. I've also worked harder than I've ever worked before. At the end of these past
two years I find myself utterly exhausted and in need of a change of pace.

## Available for Hire

If you're in search of a Senior Engineer to join your dev team, I'm looking and
immediately available! I bring ~15 years of web development experience to the table, a
passion for testable, maintainable code, an insatiable appetite for learning
new things, and some leadership experience.

If you'd like to know more, here's my [resume](https://github.com/jeremykendall/resume) 
(a printable version is [available here](https://gitprint.com/jeremykendall/resume)),
you can take a look at my [open source work on GitHub](https://github.com/jeremykendall), or even
spend a few minutes browsing through [some of my photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeremykendall).

## What I'm Looking For

I want to get out of my [comfort zone](http://giphy.com/gifs/thecomebackhbo-comeback-the-val-cherish-3rgXBre36c9Bnz5hV6)
and learn and do some new things. Don't need a PHP dev but you're looking for a
great Senior Engineer? If you're willing to teach, I'm willing to learn (with
the caveat that I'd much prefer an open source shop).

I need to [work remotely](http://giphy.com/gifs/photo-70s-muppets-gEfrwXsPRk14Q). My wife and I are about to have kiddo #2 and both of
our families are here in Memphis. Relocating right now would be extremely
difficult, although I would consider relocating at some point in the near
future for the right opportunity.

Additionally, here are the top three things I'm looking for in a new employer:

1. Work-life balance: I'm a crazy hard worker, and I can and will work some
   really long hours, but I'm looking for 40-50 hours/week as a regular thing.
2. A strong engineering culture working on big things: I'm less concerned about what you do as a
   company than I am with your engineering culture and practices. If you have a
   medium-large group of brilliant engineers that walk the best-practices walk,
   I'm in.
3. Tech community support and involvement: I want to work for a company that
   values sending engineers to conferences, supports and uses open source
   software, gives back to the community by means of supporting user groups,
   open sourcing tools where possible, and contributing to open source projects
   as a matter of course.
