_(This is the follow-up to yesterday's post, "[Dear Piedmont Natural Gas](http://www.jeremykendall.net/2012/12/01/dear-piedmont-natural-gas/)". Start there for the full story.)_

As I write this follow-up post, the gas has been turned back on, my hot water heater is working away, and my wife and I find ourselves on the far side of a bad situation turned good.

We last left off with a phone call from [Piedmont](http://www.piedmontng.com/) corporate and a promise to have our gas turned back on by 5 pm CST.  Not only did Piedmont come through, they came through big.  The technician they sent was early to the appointment and went above-and-beyond to make sure we were taken care of.  While I wish [this entire situation never happened](http://www.jeremykendall.net/2012/12/01/dear-piedmont-natural-gas/), the outcome is the very best of a bad situation, and I want to close this out with a big thanks to Piedmont Natural Gas.

Once Piedmont corporate learned about our problem, they went the extra mile to resolve it to our satisfaction as quickly as possible.  I don't know everything they did, but they went as far as reviewing the recordings of both our Friday and Saturday customer service phone calls, calling both my wife and myself to schedule reconnection, and taking the time to explain exactly what happened, why it happened, and then take responsibility for it.  Kudos to Piedmont.

Thanks also to all of you for being so supportive.  In the grand scheme of things, this was small potatoes, but that didn't make it any less upsetting.  The retweets, supportive comments, and personal commiserations went a long way towards making this a lot easier.
