A Louisiana artist, Linda Rambin has been painting for approximately six years. Unfortunately, her painting career has been postponed indefinitely due to the extremely aggressive form of brain cancer she is currently fighting, [glioblastoma multiforme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glioblastoma_multiforme). Diagnosed in early October 2008, Linda has had brain surgery, chemotherapy and radiation, and she is currently participating in a clinical trial that is causing her a great deal of fatigue and a host of other side effects.

The cost of Linda's treatment and care are exorbitant.  Just one of the medications for the clinical trial costs $4,500 per month, and that's the co-pay!  You can help support Linda and the Rambin family by spreading the word about [Paintings by Linda](http://lindarambin.etsy.com), a collection of Linda's original paintings on [Etsy.com](http://www.etsy.com).  The more people that visit [Paintings by Linda](http://lindarambin.etsy.com), the more of her paintings will sell, helping the family to defray the cost of her treatment. (If you're sharing about Linda's store on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com), please use the hashtag [#charlysmom](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23charlysmom). Linda's daughter [Charly](http://twitter.com/CharlyRambin) has worked tirelessly on both Linda's Etsy store and Linda's Caring Bridge website.)

If you are interested in learning more about her story, please visit [Linda's Caring Bridge website.](http://www.caringbridge.org/visit/lindarambin) There you will find a more detailed account of her struggle, a daily blog, a guestbook for comments, and a photos page.

Please keep Linda in your thoughts as you enjoy her unique and vivid paintings. They have brought her much joy, and we hope they will do the same for you.
